EXECX:
  1)  if using GOTO in starting, we do not need --skipped-- --starting--
      info... it does get cumbersome.

  2)  at least the starting isn't necessary.

  3)  while we're at it, if it hits a STOP or QUIT or other error,
      if we show the error and then dump the rest of the file(s) in
      the same indented format, it will be obvious...

  4)  think more on how to get one line at a time... a 1-line buffer that
      we print may be the only way, but i hate to use so much string space.

Subject: Significant change to EXEC commands 

Due to the overwhelming cry for monitor commands that do not
conflict with job processor EXEC commands the following is
now true in EXECX %1(216) and later:

:command   is ALWAYS a command to the job processor
.command   is ALWAYS a command to the operating system
*line      is unchanged (program data)
=line      is unchanged (program data)~r

For TOPS-10 and TOPS-20 command files, a pseudo mode is used to
designate commands which works like the old EXECX, with the one
difference that in TOPS10 mode, "." is the command prefix char
and in TOPS20 mode, "@" is the command prefix characer.  In both
of these modes, :command is illegal and ::label does not work!

in %1(217) and later, the pre-declared keyword $Format contains
the string "TYMCOMX", "TOPS10" or "TOPS20" and may be set by the
user.  in some future version of SUBMIT the FORMAT option will
allow users to submit jobs in each of the available formats.

/Carl                The documentation should be updated and shipped
                     at the same time %1(216) or later is distributed.

Carl,

I've looked at (HELGEM:62) SUPCHK.WOK, and at the SUPCHK.SAI in
(SUBMIT:33)SUPCHK.FDM.  I did a DIFF on the SUPCHK.WOK & SUPCHK.SAI files in
(HELGEM:62).  There is no significant difference between the 2 versions, in
the 'CheckMail' routine.  

I looked at the 'CheckMail' routine.  I have seen some possible problems.
That routine has some code I don't understand.  (Of course, that may be due to
the level of my knowledge of SAIL.)

Operations tells me that SUPCHK performs the 'something wrong' loop in the
CheckMail routine every 15 minutes, since Bill's patch to RPG MAIL.

This is pretty much what I had called you about yesterday afternoon.  I
believe I have found another possible route to fix your "message returned
because mail not read in 30 days" problem.  

The data centers use a program (SUPCHK) to monitor all OPER mail, all BATCH
requests, etc., on all hosts in their data center.  The program would not be
difficult to change, to enable it to run RDMAIL.  

This would take care of the problem of TUMS mail not read by OPER.  It would
not take care of other users, though.  Maybe we should leave things as they
are.  What do you think?

JOBS.CTL is in (PJ).  It is on all systems so as to be a "human readable"
copy of JOBS.DAT.  Copy it to your directory, edit and CPY it, then PCOM it.

BTW: 100% of the built-in font is 6.25 line per inch.  This allows 66 lines
to fit in 10.56 inches, instead of requiring 11 inches.  The normal 6 lines
per inch is actually 104% on the LN03.

A bug in SUBMIT's verifying wild-card job I.D.s.
I believe the following happens, and is undesirable:  
A user with access to other users (ie: with Account Supervisor status) gets
different responses to the use of a wild-card character in the job ident-
ification for the command, depending on whether he has a job which meets
the I.D. specs provided.

E.g.:  I had a job entered, name:   (DENCOFF)TST1.  I entered 4 more jobs, all
with name:  (NOT-DENCOFF)TST1.
I gave the command:  DELETE (NOT-DENCOFF)TST1 *.  SUBMIT asked for verification
for each deletion.
I deleted 2 of the four jobs this way.
I gave the command:  DELETE TST1 *.  All 3 remaining TST! jobs were deleted 
immediately:  two from (NOT-DENCOFF) and one from (DENCOFF).

i will test further to ascertain whether the non-verifying happens when no
username is provided, or when a job with the user's username matchs the job
specs provided.

I'm mostly concerned about providing a graph as opposed to a tree.
If each license name had several license records, then you could
have two people give seperate license to a third, for example,
John might give Julie WF license, and Bob might give her AC license.
It would keep track of who gave what (even if it overlapped) and
so Bob could take away only what he gave, and so forth.  Likewise,
Julie would have a manager who might not have as much license as
she does, but could still take license away and cancel her name.
Only someone having license greater than or equal to somebody could
change the password - then only if they are her manager.

I agree about a bit saying - no good for now.  Very important.  Its
also useful to have different people control the license for dif-
ferent systems.

Carl,
  Re. your two things:

1)  I didn't know about the microbase/MHX/EXECX problem.  Thanks for the
advice!

2)  I couldn't get the LIC option to work.  I tried 4 times!  I figured:
	a) it was the old SUBMIT LIC problem,
	b) I wanted to get my job done,
	c) I thought 62 was one of the most secure Tymcom-X hosts,
	d) and I planned to get rid of the password in the .CTL file as soon
as the LIC problem was fixed!  

Hell, I was upset with you for not having fixed SUBMIT's LIC option.  Here's a
sample of what I got:

	SUBMIT> ins clean,log=clean.ctl
	OPTIONS[Insert]: lic hf
	Oper name: sppoper
	Password: 
	 ?No license set for Job.

The 'clean' job with the WF license had been entered on another day.  License
had worked then, but wouldn't work yesterday when I tried to enter the two
jobs!  That's when I put the license into the .CTL file.


	Question:  Why did the LIC option not work yesterday, after it had
worked on a previous day?

One of the changes in /B02 is to make all output from ONCE go into the
CTYLOG buffer.  This way we can tell if the operator went into FILES

Subject: XEXEC not running on 26 

It was just sitting there, sleeping, not running any jobs.  I did not see
anything in the JQL files to show why it stopped before 6-Apr-87 7:30.
When I CSTARTed it, the messages on my terminal said "starting processor"
then "abort enter" on streams 7 and 8.  That looked strange because there
was no indication that it had started streams 1-8.  That info went to the
JQL file but not the console port.

Problem: After move to Fremont, unable to get directory of new ALL FILES tape.
         TITO reports several million BPI.  Drives work on 26 but not 29.
Fix:     Sounds like problem lies after SA10 and before tape drive.  Suggested

Subject: TTR can't handle tape read errors. 

TTR is as bad as TITO in that it requires manual intervention to get it to
continue after a tape read error.  The real killer is when there are
consecutive bad spots on the tape.  TTR thinks it saw the double EOF and
give up, whereas TITO continues in this case.  In particular, TTR aborts
near the beginning of 930's ALL FILES tape C4.  I had to use TITO to get
the directory of the remaining 90% of the tape.  Ugh.

Yes, I did get your other mail (finally, ... inter-system MAIL was out
for a day and inter-net mail was out for another day or so since someone
in validations "accidently" removed username MAIL from the CUD and we
had to re-install it with a new password).  Agenda item: Is there any
design allowance to flag a username in the CUD so that it is treated in
a special manner, such that major changes cannot be performed on that
username without additional verification, i.e. "special account - Are you
SURE?" so that thigs do not get cancelled in the future.

Hi!

This is take 2, so I hope I get it right this time...Here are the figures for
the 1986 Job Search deduction:

Newspapers
 S.F. Examiner, @ $4.50/month= $36.00
S.J. Mercury, @ $4.75/month=  38.00
54 resume copies @ $.10 ea.=5.40
54 stamps @ $.22 ea.=  11.88
716 miles, (est.) @ $.22/mi.= 157.52
54 envelopes @ $.? ea.=
20 phone calls @ $.? ea.=
-------
$248.80

I found the phone bills for 1986, but as I went through them, I have found that
it's nearly impossible to ascertain which ones were job search-related. Do you 
think it would be okay to estimate $.20 per call, so we get back something?
I also don't know how much the envelopes cost; should we estimate that cost
also?

I think it would be a very good idea to print a hard copy of this mail message 
as a part of our documentation in case (God forbid!) we should ever be
audited. Okay? I wouldn't want to have to figure out how I arrived at these
figures without this. Call me if you have any questions. If I don't answer,
please leave a message, or try back later. I may be outside, drilling Czazu.
Love, Wad

Had to go back and re-do RIB to SAT.SYS.  I put page 11 where it should

saying which other file had crossed SAT.SYS with multiply used page.  Bug.
The RIB to INITIA.SAV gotset to 777777777777 because of wrong SAT.
Luckily ther was INITIA.22 on SYS which could be renamed.  DSKCLN started
for real at 9:35 CDT, finished at 10:26, and found 12 files in SYS with
bad self-pointers in their RIBs.  DSKCLN put the names in RECOV.SYS saying
their PPN was [1,635445] instead of [1,4] and no user name.  Another bug.
635445=SIXBIT/SLF/.  PIP.SHR and DIRIT.SHR also had been stomped on.
Operations restored this files,They are reloading it for real
now (11:25 CDT).  I'm going to bed.   /JMS

I put up a newer version of SMTP that
  1. is more efficient with large messages
  2. rejects large messages with the proper error code
This version (26) should fix the problem,
however if Office-1 sees fit to keep sedning
in spite of the error codes, there is little
I can do except to call Bill Barns or Bill Daul
at Office-1 and have them do something.
I'll check it in a few more minutes to see
if things have settled down.  The new
version should be sent to every system
but that's too much for now.  Did anyone
ever write a nice distribution program

Hi!

I left Czazu out until after 12M as punishment. Then I did recalls with him
until he came fast enough. So, I gave him his food and opened the side 
garage door so he can go to sleep (me too), because he kept hearing some
cats mating/fighting, and he was driving himself and me nuts! I decided to
do this because of what Vera said about ending on a positive note, Okay?

-----------------------------------------------------------------------


On 23/24 April, this software was used to take an ASP dump of F30.
The SAVE portion worked flawlessly.  When VERIFYING the tapes, some changes
had to be made to the software to make it work.  After changes were made,
the VERIFY worked.

After completing the SAVE and VERIFY, another change was made to make
RESTARTING a tape easier.  The SAVE portion of this software is ready to
be used.

Before putting it into production on all Hosts, one other phase must
be done - REBUILDING from the ASP Save, Version 7.

What is required is that two Hosts here at Fremont be scheduled to have 
this done.  Recommended hosts are:  F70 and F33.  F26 should be scheduled
sometime later on.  This schedule allows testing on all types of configeration.

Software Support will be contacted to determine the shortest procedures
to accomplish this so downtime will be kept to a minimum.

Subject: uNode questions 


Q1: 6657 has an extra DUV-11 card in it's current configuration.  Is it
    possible to have two TYMNET connections in that box and have the 2nd
    connection to node 3143 (for access to our hosts when 3146 is down)?
    I'm not asking about passthroughs and such, just 2 connections on the
    same micronode to the real world.

Q2: Is the DL11V-J card necessary in the configuration for the LSI-11 boxes?
    Currently they can be configured in one box with KD11-HA, MSV11-D,
    DUV-11, DLV11-J and DRV-11 that will allow one host connection and one
    network connection.  Can we replace the DLV11-J card with a DRV-11 and
    still run (without a console)?

Q3: About the dual DR-11 card in node 2770.  Do we know for a fact that it
    is broken?  IS there any documentation on it, what switches are for
    each DR, will one of them work, etc...

Q4: (Assuming we will not immediately replace the dual DR) Are we likely to
    be connecting the second DR11 in the 2020 to a second node, e.g. one to
    BUBB-NET?  If not, it makes sense to put it in the 11/04 and use it for
    the connection to host 118 (Yes or No?)

----------------------------
PS.  Please don't DO anything with the configuration as yet, I'd just like
     the answers to the questions for now.

    I'm planning on putting together an effective network configuration
    using as little of your time as is necessary...  Thanks for the help.

GTSAP1 STCODE. System would not run more than hour or so.

When operation try to bring F26 up with /B03 this mornning, system
crashed with GTSAP1 and crash is saved. System is now up with
SYSTEM which is /B01.

Only crash saved is on F26. The ones on D55 could not be saved because
of CRASH.SAV being 0 word long and BOOTS not quite working.

Subject: Micronode 2346 

Yesterday, I took an LSI-11/03-SE box and a BA11-ME box from the 2020 rack
and substituted the DUV-11 and DRV-11 cards from 2346 into it.  It is now
in the network as node 2346 and has been up for 20+ hours so far.  The old
LSI-11/03-LJ box is sitting on the table in the lab.

The new 2346 has the processor and memory boards that were in the box in
the 2020 rack... so, we have verified that it is not any of the communications
boards rthat were causing the problems.  We have not eliminated either the
11/03-LJ box itself (power supply etc) or the cpu and memory boards that
were in the old box.  We can worry about that later.... for now we have a
working network.

problems with the "LJ" box and no one seems to have time to find out what is

Subject: 2020 Progress (Cough) 

Some progress has been made in getting the 2020 up and running...
however, not enough...

1) By swapping the RH11's we can boot from magtape on UBA1/RH=776700
2) We have a KS1LOD.DMP file which uses UBA1 and the first RH.
3) We can load in the monitor.

after swapping the RH11s back to their original positions, we can start
to bring the system up... however, we get a PAGEME (using KSXN13) or an IME
stopcode.  IME in FILIO @ ERRRCV+12/LDB T2,PGYPNO  just after LDB PG,UNYPAC.
THis is the normal case.  If I load DDT and try to single step, or put in a
breakpoint at ERRRCV+anything it prints $n>> and then falls into the infinate
loop printing the "Manual restart from 147" message without printing any of
the stopcode info.

  All of this happens just when I try to enter FILES... I haven't gotten far
enough to even try to refresh the disks.

  The above error got me thinking maybe one of the drives/packs has a problem
so I moved the plugs around and tried a single pack (the one that had gotten
the home page inconsistancy errors) and the stopcode PCBIO(FINPCB+13) started
occurring.  At this point, I'm stopping for the evening.

Joe: If you have any ideas... let me know via MAIL, or call in the afternoon.

  And another thing... we only have 448K of memory (7 of 8 boards) in the
machine... are we missing one? is it out for repair? does anyone know?

Craig: Any help we can get on getting the other RH11 fixed, or the memory
       checked out... I doubt these stopcodes are all software problems...
       also that first drive, write-locked lamp...

Subject: Incidental location costs 

Craig,
  Dennis Ernst tells me we can not expect to run our DUV-11 or DUP-11 line
at speeds greater than 9600.  The devices will do 19.2, but the software and
the LSI-11 cannot handle the interrupts at those speeds... in fact they are
often having data over-runs at 9600 due to the single interrupt capability
in the 11/03.

  If we assume we are to house our machines 1.5 miles away from our normal
workplace with no actual operational support, is anyone taking into account
the reduced productivity caused by having to drive that 3 miles, parking 2
times (assuming that the light rail does not extend that far?), or the cost
of having to drive or take public transportation just to reload our hosts
or the micro-bases?

  Or... the fact that we would more or less be unable to car pool on any
given day, (since we might need our own auto at any time to drive over to
our lab machines?)

  I realize that these qustions might seem picky, not to mention the extra
expense of communications, maybe forcing us to use more TYMNET resources on
the public net...  we might not actually save anything in the long run by
moving our machines to another site...  >>KICK<< >>TUMBLE<<  [soapbox just
forcibly removed from beneath my feet].

  Anyway, I think I've voiced what concerns that have come to haunt me.

Subject: Micronet and Host numbers 

I've talked to validations and tehy see no reason why we cannot use some of
the two-digit host numbers for our hosts.  I still need to check with Ed Roop
about using some of the old 940 host numbers (although Jan said we could use
36 after this weekend, and 57 at the end of May) such as 10 thru 21. If so,
we can then re-use 118, 930 and 934 for DZ-11 and DZV-11 devices on our net
so that we can build circuits to them from TYMNET.

More later... probably by meeting time on Wednesday.

Subject: Takeit %50 

I modified TAKEIT to continue even though it cannot access DSK or create
a LOG file.  (IF it can, it will.  If not, C'est la vie).

I also added code to set and clear KSYS.

Except for one small detail of the HOLD command (TAKEIT keeps an internal
counter and holds it steady, while the monitor KSYS counter doesn't have
the capability to "hold" at a specific value) which needs to be discussed
and implemented based on that discussion, TAKEIT %50 is ready for testing.

One possibility is for TAKEIT to reset the KSYS word in the monitor each
minute.  I put in the hooks and code for that, but it isn't quite turned
on (Need to move it to another location).

Another is that we set the sign bit, (only allowing 17 bits for the value)
and the sign-extended 18th bit says HOLD the current value.  (Since we do
not allow the monitor to go negative... true? [I didn't check]).

We can also change the SETUUO to use ac/ fn,addr   addr/ bits,,time
   or even better                    ac/ bits+fn,,time
   or add another setuuo or two... HOLD KSYS, CONTINUE KSYS

Subject: Cause of GTSAP1 stopcode in /A02, /A05, and /B03. 

There were two changes to SWAMP involved.  1) A DSKOFF instruction was moved to
avoid possible race conditions, and 2) better load balancing by putting new 
files on the unit with most space. 

The real problem was when the DSKOFF instruction was moved and the nearby
"JRST .-3" was not noticed.  The fix was to put a label at the right place and
jump to it.  The bug did not cause problems on a lightly loaded system, the
GTSAP1 crash occurred only when SAT I/O was in progress at the instant that
a new job tried to log in.

The second change caused SAT I/O to occur when new files were being created.
It forced the RIB of the new file to be created on the unit with the most
space instead of the SAT that happened to be in core.

Now that both changes are in and working properly, the monitor allocates disk
space better.  This should cause a noticable performance improvement when
DSKB is rebuilt from TITO all-files.   /Joe

VCR tending:  If you're not leaving until Saturday, could you catch "Miami Vice"
and "Stingray" at 9:00pm Friday?  We'd like to get both shows in stereo at SP.
The way NBC has been running things, "Miami Vice" goes straight into the story
at exactly 9:00 - the timer needs to be set to 8:58 and run to the end of the
tape.  I still have your key, so we can come down Sunday or Monday with our
VCR, dub off the shows, and put a new tape in your VCR if you want that.

We have Darth set to record the shows, but can't record in stereo unattended.

I will be checking mail on 930 from Anaheim for any last minute comments.
/Joe and Sally.

SUBJECT>   DDD RESOURCES


-----------------------------------------------------------------------


Gary,
 
As I had mentioned to you previously, I want to document the
status of DDD and perhaps resolve its system resource problem
once and for all.
 
I have, at this point, had two dedicated periods of time on
system 38.  The first period being on 4/11 from 1200 to 4/12 at
1200.  During this time, it was determined that the program to
process 36,599 area code/prefix combinations would not go to
completion.  The program was re-evaluated and trimmed down to a
"bare bones" state of data collection.  Another dedicated period
of time was then utilized.  This period of time was also 24hrs,
beginning on 4/19 at 0600 and continuing to 4/20 at 0600.  During
this time, the program progressed to a completion state, but
allowed no extra time for building of competitor databases.
 
It is my opinion that the greatest obstacle facing the DDD
program is the Magnum language in which it is written.  The
secondary detractor is the load on system 38.  Both of these
problems need to be addressed.
 
In order to keep the DDD program progressing, at this point, I
will require a minimum of three 24 hour periods of dedicated time
per month. During the month of May, I will be exploring the
feasibility of migrating DDD to an IBM 370.
 
We had spoken earlier about getting a dedicated PDP-10 for
Marketing's sales tools.  I need to know what would be required
to actually implement this solution so that I can weigh the cost
of a dedicated PDP-10 vs. the costs involved in planning a major
rewrite and migration to the 370.
 
I also need to know whether any progress has been made in the
programs Carl Baltrunas was working on to assess the load on
system 38.
 
Any information you can give me will be appreciated.
 
Thanks,
 
Lynn

Subject: VCR watching 

Please don't bother to change any tapes and such... we're content to miss
the current episodes of things and to resume taping when we return.  Since
I've messed up the last three Dr. WHOs on saturdays, I'll recalculate what
next story starts a tape and continue from that point.

I just barely made it home in time to tape MIAMI VICE and STINGRAY for you.
The tape is on top of a stack of 4 tapes (which belong to you, interviews
and some early tapes I was going to copy and haven't gotten to, feel free to
take them or leave them).  Our tapes are all Maxwell EX or TDK EHG, so there
shouldn't be any problems finding your TDK HG tapes.  We taped Vice on Maxell
EX and you are free to retape it, or to just take that tape and we'll square
it later.  (not worth retaping it, for quality sake).

If you don't NEED the tape for 3 weeks, then it can wait till we return...
otherwise, since you do have the keys, you're welcome to stop by...  if so,
please water any plants that look in need.  One of our naighbors will be
taking care of Czazu and the flowers, so you don't HAVE TO come by.  (I can
spell neighbor fine, I'm just tired...)  The house is a mess, since our plans
are all in a mess... so we'd prefer not to have any visitors while we were
gone.  I'll give you a call sometime while I'm gone.

See you.

Vida,

    The four of us who support the Tymcom-X monitor and utilities need access
to outdial network hosts, in order to support Tymcom-X systems which are not
on the public network.  The need is not frequent, but when the need arises the
need is urgent.

    I have spoken with Paul Hidy about our need.  He indicated that he would
be informing you of his approval of our request.

    The usernames needing vlaidation in Group 44 are:

at X2588 (415/794-2588), or Ontyme TXS.D/COFFEY.


                                                Thanks,

Subject: REFSTR not working for 2020 systems. 

REFSTR assigns 64 pages for the KS front-end file (SYS)FEFILE.SYS, and
allocates page 14 for its RIB, but does not write the RIB to disk.
The first time a full DSKCLN is run after refreshing the disk, the pages
assigned to the front-end file system get marked as available for use.
The changes to fix this will only affect 2020 monitors.  /Joe

How do you run ERRCHK?  The built-in help message is pretty worthless in that
it does not say what order the commands are to be given, how to start it
running.  I know it understands BP devices, but what about RM (KS) or AP (F3)

Subject: Inactivity timeout bug fixed. 

There is a bug in the job inactivity timeout killer that has been fixed.
The bug has existed for some time, and caused F29 to crash 3 times this
weekend.  The noname stopcode at TTYFND+2(SCNSER+13721) was triggered when
the inactivity timeout monitor noticed a job logged in as MAIL running TMS
that had been idle for more than 15 minutes.  In the process of killing it,
accumulator J got set to 777454, which is not in the JBT tables.  The was
not noticed on F29 before because (MAIL)TMS was not running on that system
until this weekend.  (Bill said he was moving the major MAIL functions from
system 39 to system 29.)  This may also explain some of B39's crashes.

The fix is in (M33)INTKIL.PAT on all systems, and has been applied to
(SYS:29)SYSTEM.SAV=F29-P035/B03-3 and (SYS:29)NEWMON.SAV=F29-P035/B04-3.

I doubt the inactivity timer bug is responsible for any crashes on 39
since it was never used (to my knowledge).  In fact it should not be
expiring on 29, so I have to go check why it was being inactive for so
long.  -Bill

Subject: Preventing XEXEC from running after DSKCLN during system rebuild. 

As an interim solution, I have modified INITIA to not start the XEXEC job
if the file (XEXEC)INITIA.SYS does not exist.  Instead, it will output
"?INITIA cannot run XEXEC until (XEXEC)INITIA.SYS is restored from tape."
every 5 minutes until the file is created or until the OPER kills the
job.  Until Carl finishes SUBOPR, this will ensure that XEXEC does not
start after the full DSKCLN that is necessary between restoring SYS and
the rest of the structure.

If (XEXEC)INITIA.SYS is accidently deleted, just create a new one.  It
doesn't matter what's in the file as long as it exists.

It uses the same routine that is now part of "TYPE BAT" in the FILES dialog.
If you run (MPL)TYPBAT on 930, the F3 is having problems with record 0 on

Subject: /B04 is expected to have several "%% EVENT stopcode BADPAG" messages. 

Running /B02 or later once will activate the badblock recording routines.
/B04 will output a message on the CTY when a badblock is detected, all
previous monitors noticed the badblock but never said anything.

This means that system that starts running /B04 on the old disks is expected
to get sporadic BATPAG messages until the first time an ASP is done.  During
the ASP, flurry of up to 20 BADPAG messages would not be unusual.  After the
ASP completes, the number of new BADPAG messages should slow to less than
one a week.  Operations can run (MPL)TYPBAT to see how bad the disks are.

The point I'm trying to make is that the sudden flare-up of BADPAG messages
is not the fault of the new monitor.  The disks are getting read errors and
a deficiency in the previous monitors caused problems to not be reported.

Subject: Possible explanation for the multitude of BADPAG occurances. 

We have observed two kinds of bad spots on the disk.  A real one is consistantly
bad - you couldn't read it last week and you can't read it this week.  All the
bad spots on 930 (62's disk) are real.  A phantom bad spot causes a read error
once - copying the file to itself clears up the read error.  Almost all of the
read errors on the IBM disks are phantom.

It looks now as if there is (and always has been) a bug in BPXKON.  Whenever the
monitor decides to read in a bunch of pages on the same cylinder, it calls
BPXKON repeatedly until BPXADD says it can't handle any more.  If the pages are
contiguous on disk and contiguous in core, BPXADD is given a request that could
very easily exceed the size of the command list.  When this occurs, BPXADD is
committed to do the transfer, so it has to split it up and do the second part
after getting an interrupt from the first part done.  When a request spans the
track boundry, BPXKON has to create a new select-head command before it
continues building read commands.  I do not like the code that handles end-of-
track and changed that section in CPXKON.

My reason for suspecting BPXKON is that for all but 2 of the read errors, it
was for records 15-18 of an even track.  If BPXADD did not recognize the end
of the track, it would attempt to read records 19-22 of the current track
instead of 1-3 of the next track.  Of all the ERRCHK reports I looked at, they
all said "Search error, Count error, Record 18".

If BPXKON did have this failure in the past, a read error would occur when the
read request filled up the command list and overflowed onto the next track at
the same time.  This scenario is a virtual certainty when running ASP.  ASP
would get 30 errors per disk, not report them (because it turned off error
checking on read), and CORE1 would attempt to log them in the BAT pages when
the pages were released.  Since the BAT self-pointers were not initialized,
nothing would get into the BAT pages.  The only trace left that a read error
had occured is that the "M" bit would be set so the page would not be 
recycled.  This would last only until the next DSKCLN, at which there would
be no log of the phantom read error.

P035/B04 had two changes.  One is that the read errors get logged to the CTY
as BADPAG stopcodes and logged in the BAT pages.  The second is that MAPIO
now makes new files be allocated to contiguous pages on disk when it is
convenient to do so.  This second change makes disk I/O more efficient.  It
also increases the probability that programs other than ASP will cause the
channel command list to get filled up and trigger the BPXKON bug.  CPXKON does
not exhibit this bug.

Therefore I suggest we go forward with /B04 on all 3650/3652 systems.
Until BPXKON is fixed (or CPXKON verified as reliable with 3675 blocks),
the 3675 disk systems should NOT run /B04 (or /B05).

To verify some of the things I've said, we need to run ASH on all systems.
If it is BPXKON, then unreported read errors would cause ASP to write bad
data to tape.  If system 39 is any indication, then the bug means that 30
out of 68680 pages per unit were written bad.

Subject: BPXKON/ASP ? 

Is it possible that the "read errors" we see with BPXKON while running an
ASP are indeed caused by the same BPXKON problem causing the BADPAG stopcd's?

(or am I barking up the wrong tree)?

Subject: HELP version 6(75)-2 has been distributed to all systems. 

Sometime back we decided to have the HELP command run (SYS)HELP instead of
RPG.  I put a hack into DEC's HELP program so that it can find files on (SYS).
It now responds to "HELP" to give general info, "HELP *" to give a list of
available topics.  Once we have a suitable base of *.HLP files distributed,
we should mention it in (SYS)ACCESS.MSG.   /Joe

Subject: Telephones at MDC center 

Craig,
  as per the 5.18.87 minutes for the relocation users group concerning
telephones at MDC center...

"Wiring orders have been placed for the telephone system.  The Scheme
calls for two terminals and one voice line per office.  Work areas and
file rooms requiring special requirements need to be identified with
your telephone coordinator.  Departments requiring other than twisted
pair wiring for data need to contact Judy Carlson.  Recommended tele-
phone equipment standards will remain as issued."

Our telephone needs (as we presented them for the current AT&T system
at Liberty) with multi-line capability for the hotline, support-line
and our own individual lines with call-hold (via call-waiting or multiple
lines for our individual stations) do not fall into the "two terminals
and one voice line per office" guidelines.

Are we going to be able to have the multi-line phones in the new offices
with these capabilities?

Will we need more than twisted pair to communicate with our micronodes?
Will our access to our micronodes be via the phone, or via hard lines?
If by phone, what data speeds and might we not want a couple of direct
dial modems installed on dataset lines on the micronodes in the new lab
building?  (I guess we still need to talk to Judy Carlson about this?)

You had to give your "old" password to get into SETOP.  Normal users use
the OPPS program which does ask for the old.  SETOP is intended to allow
managers to change the passwords of people under them.  Obviously this does
not require knowledge of the old one.

When a manager runs setop... before he can do anything, he must give his
own password... (and if you don't have WC set, I believe it does ASK for OPER
name and password).  Bill, you have enough license that you were not validated
when you changed the password.

Anyway, it makes sense that anyone doing anything should validate himself and
super licenses should still require the validation.  At present, if WRS or CARL
validated themselves, then they could only change people under them... that's
the way SETOP works.

We will have "super-user" status still.. but validatin is required to produce
a proper audit trail. So we should include the validation... and maybe.. just
maybe provide a way in to re-create the world if something happens to th
password file and it needs reconstruction.

I verified that system 32 could reload from SYSTEM by itself if SW4 is off.
Unfortunately, I set sense switch 4 in order to do a FULL DSKCLN, and forgot
to turn it off.  X32 is probably at ONCE> right now, waiting for a GO.
Whoever gets there first should turn off SW4 so it can continue.  /Joe

Subject: Status of 32XB03 and 32XB06. 

I spent this afternoon at Building-C trying to find out why 29XB03 worked but
32XB06 didn't.  TELECOPY would not work with 32XB03 either, until I made
32's CONFIG file look like 29's.  The only significant difference was
"XP JOBS,^D64" versus "XP JOBS,^D80".  I tried adjusting JOBS.  TELECO does
not work with JOBS set to 64, 72, 76, 77.  It does work with 78, 80, 108, 127.
I don't know why.  32XB06 works now that I set JOBS to 127 and added the
following to COMMON:
  IFCPU(<KI,KL>),<IFL JOBN-^D78,<
  PRINTX ? TELECOPY won't run with JOBS less than 78>>

I think you misunderstood.  I was saying that SETOP currently behaves properly.
It DOES require your password before you change anyone else's.  It either
requires it when you set WC with the OPER program, or when you enter SETOP.
Both would give you an audit trail if SETOP kept one.  I see no need for any
change to the procedure.  -Bill

Bill,
  I did misunderstand you at first... thought you were complaining that it
didn't work right.  I  was also explaining that it DID work correctly, but
I feel that SETOP should keep it's own audit trail, and require a password from
the person running SETOP, before allowing any changes.  Allow reading without
a password, however.

Subject: Hack to BPXKON installed on 58. 

The unit data block has enough room in the command list to handle 18 blocks
(1 track).  If a request for several contiguous blocks starts in the middle
of the track, then it will hit the end of the track before it hits the end
of the command list.  A portion of the spaghetti code near TRNCNT is supposed
to handle this, switch to the next head, and continue adding until the
command list is full.  That is one of the places I was uncomfortable with.
By putting a JFCL at TRNCNT+3, BPXADD won't do any fancy footwork to fake out
FILIO.  It will simply take the non-skip return, which tells FILIO to not add
anything more until the transfer-done interrupt comes in for the current
request.  Then FILIO will resume with the next block (which need not be on
a page boundry).

I logged in to 58 to test this, and found it SHUT due to all the "hard" errors.
Without the patch, ASH got several errors within the first 7000 pages.  With
the patch installed, it got no errors.   I zeroed out the BAT blocks so we
and the CTY can see new entries.  /Joe

Subject: Found BPXKON bug for /B06. 

If the command list is big enough to hold 25 blocks, then there were cases
where BPXKON would transfer the last 2 blocks on one track, and then try to
transfer 23 blocks on the next track.  That does not work - 3675's have only
18 blocks.  BPXKON assumed that the command list was a certain size, and
never checked it.  The following is now in /B06 for systems with 3675 disks.

Subject: License granting 

Bill,
  I started to make a list of things to augment the current SETOP database
as per our meeting and it seems that we can get similar results (as seen in
the detailed plan) by using your suggested text-file format with some minor
additions.

1.  Keep the OPER password file info the same.
    Make a text file that corresponds to the password file containing the
    information to re-create the password file plus the following:
    a. Employee Number
    b. Employee Name
    c. Username (followed by optional additional legal usernames)
    d. Security mail address (TUMS or ONTYME)
    e. Entry date (creation of record)
    f. Employee Change date;Employee Change author
    g. Password Change date;Password Change author
    h. Granted-Received license list (format)
       G;license-names;OPERNAME;date-granted;start-date;stop-date
       R;license-names;OPERNAME;date-granted;start-date;stop-date

The "G" or "R" determines whether the record is a license granted to
someone else or to this opername.  OPERNAME refers to the grantor or the
grantee.  Date-granted is when the change was put into effect and is the
default value for start-date.   Both start-date and stop-date are optional
and if missing default to date-granted and forever.

This capability to generate license values from granted license gives us
the technical structure we want.  Only SETOP cares about the managerial
structure, so it should make no difference at all if different users have
capabilities that their managers don't have (in the password file).  And
the new SETOP would do everything with the text file (locking the entire
file just as it is done now).

What about Phone numbers?  Do we want them for the records with requests
to update them periodically when people change departments?


comments?

/carl

The last question I have is... do we start with one super user that grants
license to some special people and then we propagate this by saying that
licenses are granted by the current managers???   Or do we say, noone has
any license and start acceptng applications for licenses?

The structure works fine once it is in place... but the initial placement
still needs to be ironed out.  I can have somehting together that reads
the format I've prescribed and manipulates the records in memory within
2 man weeks... but how are we going to implement it?

Another possible idea is to accept applications and build the new password
and data file strictly by application and when the cut-over date occurrs,
no-one except those that have applied and have added their own sub-accounts
will exist in the new system.  This would install users and let them run
the new SETOP / OPPS, although it wouldn't take effect until Sept 1, or some
other date.  (I prefer 1,DEC or 1,JAN since it would mean everyone would
be moved into new quarters and we'd get NEW phone or location numbers).

System 38 had the HDA on BPA3 go bad.  PAKCPX had problems copying out the
pack due to "equipment check" on head 21 record 20 on 344 of the 555 cylinders.
I hacked at PAKCPX to get it to continue after such errors.  Rick Daniels read
the numbers to me over the phone, I wrote a quick program to create a DDT file,
and used TSTSUP on system 38 to create (JMS)BADPAG.MUP which had pointers to
all those pages in its RIB.  This caused DSKCLN to report the names of all the
files that were using those pages.  (JMS)FIX38.* shows what happened.  The end
result is FIX38.FIL (which was copied to (OPER:38)FIX38.FIL) which lists 274
files and 3 UFDs being damaged.  Restoring these files will be a lot quicker
than redoing the rebuild.  Time-in=02:18, time-out=12:31.   /Joe

Subject: WHEN program change 

TO make WHEN work correctly with ARGPAR, only switches may exist in the
SWITCH.INI file.  To make the OLD usage of WHEN work do the following:

Old:  WHEN  /MULTI CARL, OSMAN, JMS
New:  WHEN  /MULTI /USERS:CARL, OSMAN, JMS

You may also specify /USERS:xxx on the command line, but that defeats the
purpose of the command line and overrides it. SO, proper usage is:

WHEN user,user/switch
WHEN ?
WHEN

This works but the results are funny:

WHEN user1,user2/USERS:user3,user4

...this reports user3 and user4, completely ignoring user1 and user2.

I made up an agenda... of course, it was written in a vacuum, so there
may be things I left out, and things I put in that should be thrown out.
Please feel free to look at the agenda and make changes.

I moved it to (INFO)AGENDA.TXT out of (MONDOC) as mentioned last week.
I also typed in the significant things I had noted from the last meeting
as the minutes.  The minutes currently precede the agenda, since they
inevitably replace the agenda.. if we follow it !!!

See you all at the meeting.

Subject: System 38 will bring up P035/B07 tonight. 

I looked at the tracks left in the circular buffer and found a cause of
THUNGs.  There were several outstanding read requests, including one for unit
324.  When a request for 314 was added, for some reason it got a busy signal.
This is normal, the unit will be restarted when the not-busy signal comes in.
When the transfer on unit 324 finished, the not-busy signal came in as if it
were for units 320-327 instead of for units 300-317 as was expected.  Therefore
CPXKON tried to restart waiting units on BPB (unit 324 is BPB4), but not the
units on BPA (unit 314 is BPA14).  The THUNG was because unit 314 was not
restarted within 3 seconds.  Until we teach COMMOD and CPXKON that a single
controller (BPA) can have more than 16 disks, I put in a one-line hack that
restarts all waiting units when the not-busy signal comes in.  It will now find
any waiting unit, be it on BPA, BPB, BPC, or BPD.

Subject: Why /B07. 

Craig and Dennis:
  The previous message did not mention that the decision to create 38XB07
was made by Osman, Carl and myself.  The change is one line to CPXKON, but
is necessary to solve the THUNG problem on 38 and 3652 systems.  We also
decided that all systems currently running /B06 should come up on /B07 as
soon as possible.  The systems we scheduled to run /B06 next week will be
running /B07 at that time.

The correct fix (which will be after P035/C) will be to teach COMMOD and
CPXKON that there can be more than 2 strings on a controller.  The places
that currently store 16 flag bits in a halfword need to be modified to
handle 64 bits in two words.  Then update the CONFIG files so that systems
with many strings on a single physical controller show up as a single
logical controller.  In particular, system 38 will have BPA0-BPA27 instead
of BPA0-BPA17 + BPB0-BPB7, and systems with 3652s will have BPA0-BPA7 +
BPA40-BPA47 instead of BPA0-BPA7 + BPC0-BPC7.

The above change will make CPXKON aware of reality.  When it determines that
controller "BPA" is busy, it will correctly understand that the units on all
4 strings on that controller are busy.  Prior to /B07, CPXKON figured that
because the second 2 strings were assigned to "BPB", that it was a seperate
piece of hardware, and was not affected by "BPA" being busy.

I expect 38XB07 will not get any THUNGS.    /Joe

Bill,
  I've been asked to reccommend what kind of modems/line-drivers to

  Since we're using DUP-11 or DUV-11 hardware which can't really run
faster than 9600 that is all I need...

  can you suggest any particular modems, or direct me to the information.

The contents of JBTCMP,JBTCP2 are the low&high 2-word result of the
KL EBOX time (RDEACT instruction) since system startup.  JBTCMP(J) and
JBTCP2(J) contain the KL EBOX time per job, since login.

We currently throw away the MBOX time, by overwriting it with the EBOX
time.  ICP reports the total of the EBOX times for all jobs for the
interval taken, divided by the fraction of a second to give MCY/SEC.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------


TYMCOM-10 Software Support will at times send mail to Operations
with instructions to bring a system up on a different monitor
and when it should be done.

Normally it is done during regular scheduled downtime.  The exceptions
to this rule are:

     a.  If a system is continuously going down; or

     b.  If USERS' are having problems with their software; or,

     c.  Problems of an EMERGENCY nature.

In these cases, they may request the system be recycled immediately
after they have solved the problem.  The crash code to use during
this recycle is the same crash code that was used when the problem
first developed.

Whatever shift this occurs on, the Operator should contact their Shift
Supervisor, or Senior Operator.  Please contact me if you cannot contact
the Shift Supervisor, or Senior Operator.
                                                                Page  2


The Shift Supervisor, or Senior Operator, should insure that the system
logbook has complete information entered into it.  They should also 
insure that:

     a.  SSW #4 is set

     b.  A note put on the CTY as to what monitor to bring system
         up on when recycled again or if the system should go down.

     c.  A monitor tape made for the host to use for COLDSTARTS.

     d.  Run DSKMAP to see if it has been updated.

     e.  Run R CRSHID;/SYS on the host to check monitor versions
         installed.

     f.  If there is a difference, then run RU (QASYS)MAPUPD.
         This program will update the DSKMAP.

     g.  When completed, run DSKMAP again and post it on the
         mainframe.

Please contact me if you have questions.

Thanks;

SUBJECT>   Testing ASP (Version 7)


-----------------------------------------------------------------------


The weekend of 18 July this software will be tested on system 58.
Between now and then, 14 disk packs need to be set up to be used.

For the next few weekends, I will schedule this system down at 2400
on Friday nights until 0800, Saturday mornings.  The regular ASP dump
will be rescheduled for this timeframe.  The remaining time after the
dump is to be used to REFRESH, FORMAT, and INITIALIZE the packs.

On the weekend of 27 June, 7 packs will be done, or as many as possible,
and 7 packs the weekend of 4 July.  If the weekend of 11 July is needed to
finish up, it will be scheduled.  These packs will be identified and set
aside for use on 18 July.

On 18 July, the system will be scheduled down from 2400, Friday night
with a scheduled uptime of 2400, 19 July.

                                                                Page  2

During this time an ASP dump will be taken on F58 using (OSU)ASP.SAV
(Version 7) software.  After tapes have been verified, the system packs
will be taken off-line and put aside.

The packs that were set up previously will be put on-line.

After the file structure has been built, the ASP tapes will be restored.
After the restore, the system will be UNSHUT for users.

Any problems, a backup will be taken (if possible), and the packs will
be switched.

Please see me if questions.

This is a follow-up on my ONTYME A73074.

Sequence of events leading up to the ASP test on 18 July and responsi-
bilities:

22 JUN     DAYS

Obtain 14 good disk packs and make up slap-tags.  Slap-tags will be
identified as follows:

     a.  Pack ID

     b.  Vender and serial number of pack.

     c.  NEW (ASP VER 7)

                                                                Page  2

When completed, packs will be stacked in the vicinity of F58 disks
drive and identified why they are there.  A list of pack serial
numbers will be provided the COORDINATOR.

26 JUN     SWINGS

Locate the 14 disk packs above and put in front of disk drives as
identified on slap-tags.

27 JUN     MIDS

Start ASP using (OSU)ASP, Version 7 on current running disk packs.

I will be in before ASP dump is completed to assist in pack movement.

Please contact me if any questions.

o  Base crashes occurs at both Data Centers PDP10's.  Frequency of the
   crashes is about the same.  One of the enhancement we have in the
   que about TYMCOM-X and EBUS slot code is to eliminate some of these
   type of crashes: TTYBMT, TTYBPN, CNTPRT, ZAPBUG, BASE etc.

o  Yes, Joe is looking into FTACFC STOPCD crashes.

Subject: Created /B08 instead of /B07-1. 

As per discussion (with JMS, CARL, OSMAN, DENCOFF present), the fix system
38's FTACFC crash will not be distributed as a DDT patch.  Instead, /B08
will replace all copies of nnXB07.SAV.

The crash on F38 showed FTA3 was given a command, FTA1 interrupted while
waiting for FTA3 to finish so FTA1 was given a new command, then the unit
check on FTA3 was noticed.  Due to what appears to be a minor glitch in the
SA10 microcode, the pointer stored at memory location 300+2 implied FTA1
when the unit-check was reported for FTA3 at location 300+1.  This
inconsistancy caused the FTACFC stopcode, which is the same as KAF with
CH1's PC indicating a loop at PI channel 3 at SGPREV in FTASER.  The patch
is to set T4 to a reasonable value and return instead of getting stuck in
a very slow loop searching 256K for the bogus pointer.

P035/B04 includes the ability to run with AR/ARX parity trap enabled.
         It runs on systems with 365x disks.

P035/B06 fixes the problem of bogus "search errors" on systems with 3675 disks.

P035/B07 would normally be called P035/B06-1.  It fixes the problem of THUNGs
	 on systems with 3 strings on a single 3674 and on 3652 disks.

P035/B08 would normally be called P035/B06-2.  It allows the system to continue
	 after an FTACFC stopcode, which occurs only when unrecoverable read or
	 write errors occur on one FTA while a second FTA is doing I/O.

With the possible exception of system 39, we want to be running /B08 on all
systems in the Fremont Data Center.

Our current monitor configuration can handle only 32 jobs when 64 disks 
(8 strings) are defined.  Lowering the number of disks to 48 allows 80 jobs,
and with 32 disks 128 jobs can be handled.

These limits are based on the restriction currently in ONCE that the entire
monitor (including the symbol table) fit in 112K of unpaged core.

Subject: "Brought F29 up on NEWMON manually"... 

Brought F29 up on NEWMON (P035/B08) manually to rerun HS2287 ONTYME
accounting tape.  This was done to see if the system would cacrash with the same STOPCODE that occurred on 22 Jun.

After bringing the system up, I mounted this tape of FTA2
and started the restore.  I also mounted a tape on FTA1 and started
storing the directory of UTIL to it.

The accounting tape stopped after "Creating User Information" typed
out (same place as before).  The TITO tape stopped shortly after this.
Approximately one minute later, F29 went down with same "KAK" stopcode.

(That's KAF, not KAK)

I then dismounted the tapes and brought the  system up.  I have the
hardcopy if additional information is needed.

Rick


---------------------------------------------------------------------

Thanks Rick.  This is very valuable information.  Please save the tape
that causes the crash.  We will be talking about this in our group meeting
this afternoon and come up with another patch/fix to the monitor to
fix the problem.

Subject: License... 

As per our "wall" discussion, I'd like you to think about this:

What if,  license on a file worked like a "protection".
          If a file has more license than the process attempting to
          update or supersede (ENTER UUO) then the "ENTER" fails.
          Rename to reduce the license (or increase the license) would
          always succeed if the process has the final license.

So, just as you cannot delete a file marked NO NO NO, you can rename it
    to a lower protection, and delete it.

So, a file with license can only be copied by a process with that or greater
    license.  It can be renamed, reducing the license, then copied, renamed
    or deleted.

    This also prevents accidently renaming a file, losing it's license, and
    never knowing it....  a current problem, not so much a security risk.

--------------------
So, what about TELECOPY, of files with license?  Trying to copy files to
files on other systems without license would fail (as it should).  TELECOPY
should be fixed as part of implementing such a scheme (as it would need to
be fixed, in order to work correctly).
--------------------

What do we really lose?  The convenience of being able to create a file and
then have to manually put license on it.  If a file has a license and it is
to be superseded, the license goes away (unless it is specified in the ENTER)
(which many programs such as LINK do not know enough to do).

I'm not advocating this change.... I just want us to think about it, and
how something similar could help our "license" problems with new, restored,
updated, copied, stolen programs and/or data.

One feature we would like to keep is the current one where if the job has
enough license, and the existing destination file has any license, then a
superseding ENTER preserves license.  That is "!GET (OSU)LOGINN" followed
by "!SSAVE (SYS)LOGINN" preserves the old protection and license.  Is this
what you meant by "license should be like protection"?  I agree that a frame
that has WF but not JL should get an error on ENTER if it were to try to
supersede (SYS)LOGINN.SHR.

Subject: License disappears (sometimes) on RENAME. 

After reading Carl's message I did some testing.  I GFDed to SPL, and then,
without setting license, I tried ".RENAME COPY.S=COPY.SAV".  The file COPY.SAV
had JL and RF license before and after.  (And still after renaming back to
COPY.SAV.)  Then I tried ".RENAME (JMS)COPY.SAV=(SPL)COPY.SAV".  The license
disappeared when the file changed directories!  After reinstating JL and RF,
I tried renaming it the other direction, from my logged in directory to the
GFDed directory.  License went away.  One last test was to reset everything
and set WF only on my frame and then try renaming across directories.  This
time RF survived (since it is implied by WF) but JL did not.

Until today I did not know that license got left behind on a RENAME.  It is
not what I expected.  However the preservation of license when doing
 "RENAME (SYS)PROGRAM.OLD=(SYS)PROGRAM.SAV" is a feature worth preserving.

Yes, want to preserve:  load/get program; SSAVE program     keeps license
      if you have the same license... although, if you don't have ALL the
      license, I think it ought to fail... you should NOT be able to do
      anything by way of ENTER if you do not have same or greater license.

Rename across directories, if you don't have license, it goes away... as
      expected.  Are you saying that if you HAVE the license, it also goes
      away just because it is across directories?  (It should always go
      away if you don't have it [now] whether or not it is across dir's
      but you should be able to rename license across dir's if you have it!)

My suggestion is to make the enter fail, if you do NOT h
ave enough license
which would cause a "protection"/"license" failure and abort...  so people
can't "accidently" rename or copy over a file that has license.

Subject: 8 of 10 crashes on 33 are SAXINX 

Most of F33's crashes are KAF stopcodes, but the crash dumps show that a
SAXINX info stopcode had just occurred and the info hadn't gotten a chance to
type out on the CTY.  One crash implied that the SA10 stopped working the
time it was determined that the SA10 caused the interrupt and the time the
status was read to determine which channel caused the interrupt.  The
changes to COMMOD in /B09 will get more information and try to continue.
Note: This does not affect F29's problem with reading ONTYME accounting.
That problem is still under investigation.     /Joe

I believe /B09 will help F33's KAF stopcodes due to heavy FTA usage.
However F29's KAF stopcodes from the ONTYME accounting is a different problem,
and needs further study.  I will send another message later today.  /Joe

Subject: Found loop in FTASER. 

FTASER has several phases of "DC-R" recovery (DataCheck-Read).  Phase 1 is to
re-read the record forwards.  Phase 2 is to read the record backwards.  Phase 3
is to continue reading backwards if phase 2 worked but did not read the entire
record.  The calculation to determine where to resume reading misinterpreted
the command list and got into an infinite loop (causing KAF).  The check for
getting out of the loop failed if the current command list did not start at
the beginning of the area reserved for command lists.  The fix was to stop at
a zero word as well.  
File 1)	DSK:FTASER.B09	created: 1516 22-JUN-87

The system does not hang anymore.  However, the OSIRUS RESTORE program tries
to re-read the same record over and over again.  But that's its problem (or
possibly a misfeature in FOROTS).  P035/B10 will be put on F29 tonight, and
eventually all other systems in Fremont.    /Joe

Subject: Hotline (type) call 

System F30 was experiencing a rise in hard device errors on BPA6.  They
took the system down to do a PAKCOP of the pack (3675's) and saw the same
hardware check problem we had with system 38 two weeks ago.

Rick called and wanted to know if it was OK to use Joe's modified PAKCOP.
I said, go... and we realized that that version was for 3650's in blocks.
We decided to run ASP version 7 to copy out the pack to tape and then do
a restore to a new pack.

We did a compare of the save prior to the restore and found 78(*) pages that
did not copy exactly.  Nothing was done to see how "off" the pages were.
We restored the tapes to a new drive/pack and I created a file with 78 pages
in it for DSKCLN to find multiply used pages and mark the files bad.

System came up with a FULL DSKCLN and reported errors as expected in RECOV.SYS
and on the console.  One UFD was affected.  Operations has the list of files
from FNDBAD to restore and the UFD name to work through the all-files and
backups.

I told them to call us if they had any more problems.

We received a verbal "thanks" from both Bob Fischer and Cheryl Eldred for
saving them a rebuild.

Subject: RDIST program (finally) 

I've finally written RDIST as promised.  It updates files on multiple systems.
I've attached the manual page for it.  Locations are:
  source:  (XEXEC:29)RDIST.SAI
  document:(XEXEC:39)RDIST.PUB
I'll be putting it on XEXEC everywhere soon.  Advise of suggestions.  Please
consider fixing TELECOPY to allow the TALK command in a command file and to
not always update existing file (i.e. supercede).  -Bill
   (XEXEC)RDIST                    Tymcom-X                     (XEXEC)RDIST


   SYNOPSIS

           Remote file distribution.

   SYNTAX

           RDIST outfile=f1,f2,...,fn/USER:u/HOST:h/CHECK/LIST/TRACE/VERBOSE

   DESCRIPTION

           RDIST maintains  duplicate copies of  selected files  on multiple
           systems.   This is  accomplished by  building a  circuit  to each
           system  and running  the (SPL)FINDIT  program to  obtain creation
           date, checksum, protection and license data on the  files.  RDIST
           then  builds a  TELECOPY command  file and  executes  TELECOPY to
           update those files which have incorrect checksums.

           The parameters are as follows:

             outfile=      output file for status log; default is no log

             f1,f2,...,fn  files to be updated, each may contain user name
                           and wild cards; if no user name is given the
                           one given by /USER:u is assumed; default is *.*

             /USER:u       login name to build circuit under (requires AC
                           license); default is current user

             /HOST:h       list of host numbers to update; default is all

             /CHECK        do everything but run TELECOPY

             /LIST         generate list only; does not compare files or
                           run TELECOPY; replaces running FINDIT via MHX

             /TRACE        show circuit traffic on terminal for debugging

             /VERBOSE      show status of each file, even if its current;

   CAVEATS

           The program has no way to correct bad protection or license.

System 58 users were complaining that the MAIL command produced "Address Check

(MAIL:35)MAILER.SAV wrong protection.
(MAIL:58)MAILER.SAV wrong checksum
(MAIL:58)SENDMA.SAV wrong checksum
(MAIL:58)RDMAIL.SAV was causing "ADDRESS CHECK", I telecopied from 29
(MAIL:62)MAILER.SAV wrong protection, no license
(MAIL:62)RDMAIL.SAV no license

Subject: SETOP should clear input buffer if no DRWSPR.EPO file. 

There is a very small window between the time that PJ copies the new oper
password file to SYS and the time that it sets WC license on it.  If an MHX
job just happens to try to use "O$" during that time, SETOP complains that
there is "NO PASSWORD FILE" and exits without clearing the input buffer.
When this happenned to me today, my oper password showed up on the command
line where anyone looking over my shoulder could see.  Because of MEXEC, it
tried to run a program matching the first word of my oper password.  This
word was then made available to SYSTAT for the world to see.

This is not good.

Of course PJ should be fixed to specify the license in the enter rather
than doing a rename after the fact.  Aside from that, OPER should also
always take a password, regardless of weather there is an oper password
file or if its bad or if the name specified does not exist.  This is the
same strategy we'll be releasing in the network as soon as we get a round
tuit.  [it also makes guessing harder]  -Bill

Subject: Memo to Ed Roop about 32 disks. 

The following is in (M33)32DISK.MEM.  Whoever is going to the meeting in 
Solar Way at 13:00 on 7/02/87 can give copies to Roop, Fischer, etc.
			/Joe

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

From the TYMCOM-X Support Group.
In reference to memo from Ed Roop dated June 4, 1987.

We are currently running a monitor with 32 disk addresses defined.  F74
has 29 active spindles disks, F38 had 28 active disks before it was
converted.  Running with 32 units of model 3675 disks is not a problem.

We have run a test monitor configured for a 3652 system with 32 addresses
and a test monitor configured for a 3652 system with 64 addresses.
Although only 1 string of 3652 disks was connected at the time, we see no
problems with using a second string of 3652 disks due to the uniformity
of disk addressing.  All 32 addresses go through the same 3674 controller.

Due to the current limitation on the size of the resident monitor, a
system can be configured for more than 32 addresses only at the expense
of the number of jobs the system can handle.

        A monitor with 32 disks can be defined with 128 jobs.
        A monitor with 48 disks can be defined with  80 jobs.
        A monitor with 64 disks can be defined with  32 jobs.

Note that each additional string of 3652 disks (with 16 addresses)
reduces the maximum number of jobs by 48.  There is an absolute maximum
of 64 units per structure.  Defining the DSKB structure with more than
32 units is not recommended.  Recovering from an HDA failure on a 48 unit
DSKB would take more than 48 hours of down-time.

Unless the sytems were to use multiple structures, we cannot recommend
attaching more than 32 disk units per CPU.

We also received, in late May, four 4-digit host numbers for our use.

The THUNGs on BPA12 and BPB6 are a side affect of the HDEV:4 on BPA13.
I tried to read CYL:1 HEAD:22 RECORD:23 4 times to see if it would cause
an EVENT stopcode BADPAG on unit 12 page 511.  It did not.  However, it
took more than 3 seconds for the monitor to do all the retries on that page,
which caused the THUNGs.  BPA12 and BPB6 were not hung - the monitor was
ignoring them while doing the retries.  The best way to clear this disk
error is to ASSIGN and DEASSIGN an alternate track to CYL:1 HEAD:22.
Due to the way SPAGES is used, no data will be lost.   /Joe

-----------------------------------------------------------------------


This coming weekend, starting at 0000, 18 Jul, there will be two (2) 
ASP dumps taken on this system.  F58 is scheduled to be up by 1200,
18 Jul.

The first dumpt will be taken with Version 6 from the directory of (SYS).
The second ASP dump will be taken with version 7 from the directory of (OSU).
Use the current rotation set of tapes for the first dump.  Make up a 
second set (15 tapes total) for the second dump.  Label the tapes as:

     F58 ASP DUMP (VER 7)

     SET 0       TAPE #

After the second dump is completed and verified, the system will be taken
down.  Call me when you are half way through the verification of the
second dump.

Subject: Micronode changes 

Dennis,
  I've sent you interoffice mail with a node map and hardware layout of
the new proposed micronet.  I've created a file (CURR11:930)RUFSC.MAC that
has the routing information (a la RULAB.MAC) with the nodes that are NOT
part of our local net removed.

  I put routing info in for the host numbers that I've chosen for the DZ's
and the (future) DZV's for comment... they can be commented out so that
they would go to TYMNET and back into the micronet where necessary.  We
can talk about that part when you and I talk on the phone.

  Please call me when you receive the inter-office mail.

THey actually validated that on a PDP-10?????

They can't even look at it woth most software... I wonder if they will be
able to delete it?  NONAME won't let you look at it.

(This is a rhetorical comment... Lynn Lawrence tole me that she talked to
 you and you told her "#" was illegal in a TYMCOM-X username.)

Did you know that LOGINN runs init programs at start-address + 1 ???

(at least by demonstration... it appears that way)
(F40 may not like that... meaning, anyone using an F40 INIT program will
 experience problems depending upon what they do in their programs... the
 program in question does an LUUO '015 at the start address, and a JRST 140
 at start address+1, and it gets a HALT whenever started at start+1)

Is the behavior of LOGINN proper in your opinion?  Should it ever run the
init program at start+1... (I haven't looked, but is this documented?)

Please comment, but no urgency is required... I understand that your
domestic life has changed dramatically over the weekend and you will
definately need time to adjust.  (Are you taking any vacation time?)

Please say hello to Becky and the baby... I'll probably give you a call
but, I'm being "considerate" and waiting until the initial hub-bub has
a chance to die down...

I think it's probably the project code validation program that's running
at start address plus one.  I don't remember that being true for INIT.
What does she want to do about it?  I can still hack things if she wants
to keep the username, but I'll just have to use FET in stead of NONAME.
Oh well.  Life here is going well (and at 150%) but I've given up entirely

Thanks... you were right!  They had the same program setup as both the
INIT program and the project-code validation program, so I didn't bother
to check it...

I think F40 doesn't like to be started at start+1, so I'm going to
suggest that Lynn has a second program for PJCVFY that sets restricted
restricted mode and the INIT program to run and runs it at the regular
start address...

I think it might be nice (now that INITIA runs the init program for the
user) to allow the INIT command in restricted mode.  Maybe change INITIA
to run the RCF program if there is no init program so it works as expected.

Rick,
 
The following is a list of topics operation's personnel would liked addressed
in PDP seminars.
 
1)  Hardware
    A)  Define each component and its purpose
    B)  How each component interacts with the other
 
2)  Memory
    A)  What is it?
    B)  How and why do we deselect memory?
 
3)  System Structure & File Structure
    A)  What is it?
    B)  How is it defined and why?
    C)  Disolving and defining a file structure.
    D)  Blocks vs pages
    E)  How are files stored on disk? What are the differences between
        3675's, 3650's and 3652's.
 
4)  ASP, ALLFILES & Daily Backups
    A)  What each one is.
    B)  What each would be used for.  (i.e. rebuild, restore of bad file)
 
5)  Monitors
    A)  What are they?
 
6)  DSKCLN
    A)  What a FULL DSKCLN is and what it does?
    B)  What a FAST DSKCLN is and what it does?
    C)  How to determine if a FULL or FAST is required.
 
7)  Pakcop
    A)  What is it?
    B)  How does it work?
 
8)  Rebuilds
    A)  Process of a rebuild
    B)  What backup (Allfiles, Daily & ASP) is appropriate for rebuilds.
        (Examples of different scenarios.)
 
 
 
These are only topics that we find that we would absolutely need presented.
Additional topics that you or Tymcom10 software/hardware support feel would
be beneficial to operation's personnel would be greatly appreciated.
 
Thanks,
 
Cheryl

Subject: PDP-11 Diagnostics 

Dennis,
  It is my impression that the node code loaded by NODLOD in *.IMG files
is an image copy made using LINK11 of code that runs in the PDP-11.  It
is also my impression that *.BND files are also possible to be built and
then loaded with LOADII.

  The hardware FE's have some standard diagnostics for PDP-11 based systems
which (on the 11's with disks or tapes) can be loaded and run.

  Do you know if the format of either the BND or IMG files is the same or
similar to the DEC standard diagnostics, and if it is reasonable to expect
that we could load these diagnostics from a TYMCOM-X system using NODLOD or
LOADII?

  If the formats are different, it may be possible (should be, anyway) to
convert them to either IMG or BND file format, and then load them into the
LSI's to run memory or other diagnostics in order to trace some of our
intermittant faults.

  I am asking, because this may be the method to use to try and diagnose
why the micronode at TRW keeps halting... the symptoms suggest a power-
supply problem, but I am unsure, and would like to try another route...
besides, it will give us a way to trace and fix the intermittant problems
we have with two of our micronodes.

Subject: ACCESS# username and program 

Lynn,
  I have talked to Bill soley, and it appears that what is wrong with your
ACCESS program is that it is bumping into a restriction with fortran-IV
runtimes which do not allow it to be run at the CCL (or secondary) start
address.

  You have (MKTGINFO)ACCESS.SAV setup as both the INIT program and the
project code validations program.  I have removed it from the project-code
validations program, but in order to provide the SECURE environment that
you want to have, we need to set the user up in the LUD with logout-on-stop
and restricted-user-mode, and have it run (MKTGINFO)SECURE as it's INIT
file.

  This will cause it to check the security requirements, and then run the
program (MKTGINFO)ACCESS   [using the first 6 letters of teh username to
determine what program to run].

  I don't have the bit definitions in front of me... but I will setup the
username in the LUD when you are ready to go into production with this
program and username.  I will wait until you have the name ACCESS validated
and we use that instead of ACCESS#.

Carl,
  Once upon a time, we had a project to get the source
for the LSI-11 diags (yes, DEC sells them) and assemble them
using our PDP-11 assembler.  They could then be converted
to BND format.  However, since the normal method used by the
field people when the want to do diags is to read them from
mag tape using a portable TU-58, the project was dropped.  They are
also available on paper tape.  

I got your stuff in the mail.  Will call you when I have had a chance to 
look it over.

Subject: Changes to uNet 

Dennis,
  In addition to what you received in the mail, there a a couple of "trivial"
changes, as follows:

    o  The second DUV11 in node 2346 has been "assigned" to be the link to
       host BNET  (Network DUV11 driver)

    o  Another host number, for a DZV11 to be installed in the free slot in
       node 2346  (host #4285, I believe).  If the DLV11 can do full moden
       control, then the DLV11 would work as this host, but I believe that
       the DLV only has limited modem control... haven't really checked...

    o  Node YYYY has another host link; a DUV11 x.25 line into a microVax II.

  I have some questions regarding the host "devices" and the translations at
which points in the micronet versus host numbers for these devices.  WHen I
talk to you, I'll go over these changes and my questions.

  I believe that the routing map (CURR11)RUFSC.MAC is completely correct with
the exception of the host numbers for the DZ-11 and DZV-11s.

It just runs FINDIT so...
I suppose I could check for .TMP and try to handle it gracefully, but the
problem here is not .TMP, its binary file names.  The program RDIST blew
up here because it got two files with the same (reported) name.  I guess
that they each contained an embedded blank and differed following that so
the cvxstr routine in sail (which does the wrong thing) stops at the first
blank.  I'm not sure what the best fix would be.  Maybe FINDIT could output
otherwise illegal file names in some special way like '123456654321.XYZ.
Suggestions?  -Bill

Carl,

  I was called by Jeff.  Here is what I know:

    1.)  (NETALERT)ALERT, as an SUBMIT/EXECX job is not reliable (will not
restart at system startup), due to the lack of "notice in child frame".

    2.)  (NETALERT)ALERTT, as an SUBMIT/EXECX job which starts a detached PCOM
job, will not run the ALERT program reliably, due to the job/program dying and

as part of TrainNet.  It so happens that this is NOT going to occur.
So, the interconnect to TrainNet is now being removed from our plans.

I will regroup our systems and configuration to reflect this change and
send you a copy of the new configuration via interoffice mail.  This will
give us an option or two that we had talked about, such as possible host
numbers directly on BNET so that we can communicate with B39 without the
added gateway problems.  Possibly host 930 or something like that.

Subject: BubbNet hosts 

Bill,
  I will contact Sandy or Kal, but I thought that I'd run it past you first.
We were planning on configuring our micronet and hosts so that they could be
accessed from another network (other than TYMNET) such as as TrainNet or
BubbNet.  The connection into BubbNet was mostly for Dennis Ernst to be able
to access that micronet, but I see an advantage for System 39, if we were to
put both of our 2020s on dual bases, one host on TYMNET and one on BUBBNET
for each host.

  Since our micronet is somewhat the proving ground for what Dennis does, it
wouldn't be in conflict with having only NTD hosts on Bubbnet...  It would
give us direct connections into B39 and eliminate the gateway problems we have
in trying to support system 39 from Tymnet.

  Do you think that we would have any problems getting the host and node
connections to Bubbnet?

Jan,

  Please forward this to anyone that you think need to know about this, and
have them contact me...

  As per my previous mail about gathering information about individuals
that have license on the PDP-10s for the new SETOP replacement program, it
has come to my attention that there are many many opernames that have been
setup with only VL license.

  Is there an individual connected with each of these opernames?  Do they
have an ISG identification number?  Are they all ISG employees, or are any
of these names belonging to TYMNET customers?

  This same issue comes up for those users with just SP or RL license for
SPOOL.  I really need to get the facts about these opernames, because when
the new system is implemented and we enforce only having ISG employees with
license on our machines, this MAY be important to our system and network
security.

   Please let me know what you find out.

Sounds good to me.  I think there would be no problem so long as there
is already a bubbnet line at your location.  It is in our best interest

Subject: WHEN program change 

TO make WHEN work correctly with ARGPAR, only switches may exist in the
SWITCH.INI file.  To make the OLD usage of WHEN work do the following:

Old:  WHEN  /MULTI CARL, OSMAN, JMS
New:  WHEN  /MULTI /USERS:CARL, OSMAN, JMS

You may also specify /USERS:xxx on the command line, but that defeats the
purpose of the command line and overrides it. SO, proper usage is:

WHEN user,user/switch
WHEN ?
WHEN

This works but the results are funny:

WHEN user1,user2/USERS:user3,user4

...this reports user3 and user4, completely ignoring user1 and user2.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------


This weekend, system F33 will be down from 0000, 25 Jul until
2400, 26 Jul, for rebuilding using Version 7 of ASP.

Two ASP dumps will be taken:

     The first dump will be taken with Version 6 using the normal
rotation set.

     The second dump will be taken with Version 7, using the set
hanging in the tape library.  They should be labeled as

         F33 ASP DUMP VER 7

     VERSION 7 IS IN (OSU) DIRECTORY.

     After both sets have been verified, restore Version 7 back
onto system 33.

                                                                Page  2

     This is all that is tentatively planned, unless Software Support
decides on somthing else to be done.

     Bring system up with a "FULL" DSKCLN.

     Hold version 6 tapes for three weeks and then scratch.  Version
7 tapes will be sent off-site.

Any questions, please contact me.

Thanks

1.  As long as 62 and 930 are both working, we can reload the microbases from
the other CPU.  The 2020 can reload its microbase and 2346, but nothing else.
6657:	Use NODLOD on 62.  10115 and 2346 must be up.
10115:	Use NODLOD on 930.  6657 and 2346 must be up.
2346:	Use NODLOD on 62, 930, or 95.  The host's base must be up.
2770:	Use NODLOD on 62 or 930.  Intervening nodes must be up.
6760:	Use NODLOD on 95 running in CONSOLE mode.
Note:  After a complete power failure, 6657 and 10115 must be reloaded from
the network.  With host 57 gone, WE CAN'T RUN LOADII!!!!!! 

2. Out Dial information is in the INFO tree, topic OUTDIAL.

Subject: PDP-10 coding trick 

  In putting together my own octal print routine for my SETOP endeavor
I chose to combine the octal and decimal print routines into one.  This
had the side effect that octal numbers with the sign bit set became
a weird set of punctuation marks (since I had an unsigned print routine).

		  OOPS!

  If you start with a standard routine such as this...

  num = 1
  rem = num+1

OCTOUT:	SKIPA	rad,[^D8]		; octal
DECOUT: MOVEI	rad,^D10		; decimal
RDXOUT: IDIV	num,rad			; divide
	HRLM	rem,(P)			; save remainder on stack
	SKIPE	num			; any more digits?
	  PUSHJ	P,RDXOUT		; yes, loop
	HLRZ	num,(P)			; get digit from stack
	MOVEI	num,"0"(num)		; convert to digit
	OUTCHR	num			; print it (with routine of choice)
	POPJ	P,			; return when done

  I came up with this interesting bit of code as a work around that I had
never encountered in any bag of PDP-10 coding tricks...

OCTOUT:	SKIPA	rad,[^D8]		; octal
DECOUT: MOVEI	rad,^D10		; decimal
; ** begin trick **
	EXCH	num,rem			; setup number in remainder word
	SETZ	num,			; for 2-word divide instead
	LSHC	num,1			; shift sign (if any) to high word
	LSH	rem,-1			; shift low word back into position
	DIV	num,rad			; first divide, results same as IDIV
	CAIA				; or JRST .+2 to skip first divide
; ** end trick **
RDXOUT: IDIV	num,rad			; divide
	HRLM	rem,(P)			; save remainder on stack
	SKIPE	num			; any more digits?
	  PUSHJ	P,RDXOUT		; yes, loop
	HLRZ	num,(P)			; get digit from stack
	MOVEI	num,"0"(num)		; convert to digit
	OUTCHR	num			; print it (with routine of choice)
	POPJ	P,			; return when done

; Have you ever seen this used anywhere before?

PS.  TYMCOM-X only...
    replace
	MOVEI	num,"0"(num)
	OUTCHR	num
    with
	OUTCHI	"0"(num)		; outchr immediate

Rick says, he has seing two edits of (OSU)ASP.SAV.
One is Ver 7 (104), and the other is Ver 7 (107).
Will you please put the right edit on all the systems
and send mail to him. Thanks.

P. S.

Subject: SETOP IN ASSEMBLER 

Heavens no!!!  At least not yet...

I have run into string garbage collect problems, so I reduced string usage
as much as possible on output by encoding my own fill routines for numeric
and string output to overwrite the same large constant string...  My string
space still gets larger than 64K and string GC occurs when it needs to expand
and the GC takes 30+ seconds...

Know any way to reduce, turn off string GC?

I'm now re-thinking the data structure into multiple files to increase the
access speed.. expect that to be done the end of this week... I'm in class
over at TYMNET TRAINING (Intro to ISIS) all this week.

Let Wayne know... I may have a preliminary "GED" for him by next week sometime.
...assuming some progress is made this week.

Since (NEW11:57)ND6657.BND,ND6760.BND,ND2770.BND,ND0115.BND went away when
system 57 was shut down, I went to (NEW11:39) and telecopied the files to
(NEW11:38) and (NEW11:37).  This puts the required files on 3 consecutive
systems (37,38,39) in 3 locations (Dallas, Fremont, Bubbnet).  The TXS
micronet files in (CURR11), (OLD11), (DOC11), and (TOOLS11) have also been
copied from 39 to 38 and 37.

The ND####.BND files in (NEW11) on 62, 95, and 930 might not be correct, due
to changes in the routing table (which is not stable yet).

Dennis,
  (CURR11:930)RUFSC.MAC  is complete, showing all host and node links
for our micronet.  We do not have a kernel host # on BNET for 2346
(or have verified that 2346 is available as a node on bubbnet) and have
not getten a host number for the KS on bubbnet yet... but that will not
be needed until late October most probably anyway.

  Let us know when the code is ready so we can start reconfiguration.

Thanks again...

Do you see any problem running D56 with 200 ports.??
D56-P035/C is cut with 200 ports and ready come up with it, right?
Roy R. is asking us to come up with 200 port monitor first and
after couple of days, he will have network reload the base code
which is cut for 200 port.

Overview:

Security is a major concern in all areas of the Network.  From
restricting access to the Network to restricting the range of
capabilities a user has once a successful connection is made to a
host, security is a concern.  This proposal seeks to address one part
of the security picture.

Today, all users on the PDP Code Genning Systems have the capability to
access the NAD program in the (SYS) directory.  This program gives them
Write File (WF) license.  With this capability, any user has the ability
to over-write any file on the system they are logged into.  With NAD they
are also able to gen code and create listings of the Tymnet source code.

What this proposal seeks to control is really two fold.  First, it will
restrict which users are allowed access to NAD in the (SYS) directory.
This will remove their Write File capabilities and not allow them to
create code listings.  Secondly, it will also restrict the ability to gen
code to only those users who have been identified as requiring this
capability.


Goals and Compromises:

The ultimate goal for the implementation of restricted access was to
disallow access to the (SOURCE) and (BETATEST) directories from all
users except those that require access.  Those requiring access include
all field and Headquarters support people; Project Implementation; the
Field Service Organization; Customers who, by contract, are allowed
access; the Headquarters Quality Assurance group; and the development
organization.  Groups that required access only to a limited set of
files in the (SOURCE) and (BETATEST) directories would then be
restricted on a file by file basis.  For example, Customer A has in
their contract a license to gen X.25, Node Code and ISIS.  They would be
allowed access to only the source for this code and be barred access to
the remaining source code files.

Unfortunately, barring access down to a per file per user basis is not
possible under current TYMCOM-X limitations.  This capability would
require modifications to the Operating System.  What is possible is to
restrict access to the (SOURCE) and (BETATEST) directories as a whole
and restrict access to some of the capabilities of the NAD program. 
Thus, restricting access on a more limited basis is possible.

After the restructuring of the PDP systems, as will be documented,
restriction to the (SOURCE) and (BETATEST) directories will be on
a per user basis.  Certain users will be barred from being able to
create listings of the source code and will be able to only write files
into their own directories.  They will not be able to over-write files
at will as they can today.




Restructuring with Restrictions:

There are copies of the code genning program, NAD, on all PDP Code Genning
Systems.  One NAD is the aforementioned copy in the (SYS) directory.
The second NAD is the copy in the (SOURCE) directory.  The only
difference between these two copies of the same program is the license
assigned to the programs.  The NAD program in the (SYS) directory has
Write File license (WF).  Use of this copy of NAD allows the user to
over-write files anywhere on the PDP system they are accessing.  The
copy of the NAD program in the (SOURCE) directory has only Home File
(HF) license.  This will still allow the user to over-write files in 
directories under the same GAN.  A change to NAD would be required
to restrict this further.[*]

There is also an important feature of NAD that is part of this
restructuring.  If a user lacks TYM license, NAD will not allow that
user to create listings of the source code.  Currently, most users that
gen code have TYM license.  They are able to both gen code and create
listings of the source code.

The changes proposed to create tighter controls on the capabilities of
users on the PDP Code Genning Systems are:

1.  Remove Write File (WF) license from NAD in the (SYS) directory.

2.  Place protections on NAD in the (SYS) directory so it could only be
    called and used by users that have the license required to do so.
    Even users in the same GAN will be restricted unless they have the
    license necessary to access the code.

3.  Structure the customer directories as follows.

    A customer will have a minimum of two directories.  One will be
    under a separate GAN and will be used for CODE STORAGE.  Code that
    is operating in their network will be stored in this directory.  The
    second directory will be under the same GAN as the (SOURCE) and
    (BETATEST) directories.  This directory will be used only for CODE
    GENERATION.  The second, or CODE GENNING directory, will have an
    ACCESS list allowing the customer to GFD into this directory from
    their CODE STORAGE directory.

4.  Remove TYM license from users who should not be able to create
    listings of the source code.

5.  The (SOURCE) and (BETATEST) directories should have directory access
    protection of  SHARABLE and LISTABLE only.  They currently have
    SHARABLE, LISTABLE and NEW FILES.




By making these changes, users not in the (SOURCE) and (BETATEST) GANs,
and without proper license, will not have access to NAD.  They will be
forced to only use the NAD program in the (SOURCE) directory.  Without
the TYM license, they would be unable to create listings of the source
code.  Without the additional licenses on the NAD program they would be
unable to over-write files not in their own directory.  With directory 
access set, users will be prevented from writing into the (SOURCE) and
(BETATEST) directories.

With the current protections placed on all (SOURCE) and (BETATEST)
source code, users without the proper license will not have access to
the files in these directories.  They would be restricted from even
viewing the source files.


Concerns and Questions:

Items marked with a [*] throughout this document require further
research.

PEAK and VUE, the text editors on the PDPs, require modification if they
are to be used by users that do not have TYM license.

Will changing the customer's GAN for the code genning directory cause
any problems?  Do any other programs key off the GAN, etc.

Will the customer be allowed to log into their code genning directory
directly or only be able to access it via a GFD from their storage
directory?

Who will be tracking the change of GANs for the customers?

Who will identify the customers requiring these changes?

Who will be removing the Write File (WF) license from (SYS)NAD and the
Home File (HF) license from (SOURCE)NAD?

An ACCESS.LST file will have to be maintained in the code genning
directories to allow the GFD access from the code storage directories.
Recovery procedures will have to be established for the recovering of
these files after accidental deletion.

56XB03.SAV, 56XB04.SAV, 56XB08.SAV, 56XB10.SAV, and 56035C all have 200
ports.  56XB03.SAV is dated 6-May, we tested it, but never bothered to put

Subject: 56035C rebuilt for JOBS=160 (as well as PORTS=200). 

System 56 is currently running a monitor with 128 jobs and 128 ports.
If there are more jobs using two ports each (such as LOADII, TELECO, AUXIO, etc)
than there are jobs detached (CHKPNT, PAM, XEXEC, etc), then the system will
run out of ports before it runs out of job slots.  When this occurs, the SUP
will tell the CONSAT output the message "host out of ports" as the reason for
failure of the login request.

Back in May, we boosted PORTS to ^D200.  That by itself would allow about 3
more jobs to get logged in, and then SCNSER will have to output the message
"frame capacity exceeded" when all 127 jobs were in use.  That would not
really solve the problem.  Therefore I have boosted JOBS to ^D160.  CONF56.MAC
has been updated in (M33:930,:34,:33) and (OSP:33), and the new 56035C.SAV
copied to (M33:56).

Setting JOBS=160 and PORTS=200 should keep them happy for a while.  I would
expect the KL to get bogged down before they exceed 159 jobs.

Su:  PDP-10 Inactivity Timeout
------------------------------

Joe,

A few weeks ago, Barb V. mentioned to you that I was investigating
an inactivity timeout for PDP-10 usernames.  I'm sorry that I didn't
get back to you sooner, but I have been off chasing other monsters
the last few weeks.

Barb has mentioned that there is a 15-minute timeout available, but that
it has to be set by the user on login.  I nned to find a way to
automate this.  Is it possible to set this through an init file?

The application that we need it mostly for is to zap ELF circuits that
are still connected, but it would be useful for any user accessing
the PDP-10 host through a connection with large connect time costs.

Please let me know as many details of accessing this timeout.
I will be very grateful.

Best Regards,

Dan

Joe,

I'm not sure that you received my earlier message, but Barb V.
passed on your name to me in relation to a solution to one
of my problems involving PDP-10 system.

I am trying to use an inactivity timer on a username basis.  Barb
told me about SET AUTOLOGOUT, but I need to find a away to set it automatically
for certain usernames.  Maybe through an INIT file?

Anyway, in testing SET AUTOLOGOUT, I have found that this command
crashes system 37 when the 15 minute timeout expires.  A little
drastic, but very effective!  I've reported it through Dallas OPS,
and to OSMAN.

Anyway, when it's fixed, how can I set up a username to use this
feature automatically.

Thank you for checking with us.  It is bound to screw up
somebody, but nobody at NTD.  I think (SYS)NAD is used
mostly by Tymnet operations and private network customers.
It seems to me they need an alternative means to access
their code, but I don't understand what the procedures
are so I can't suggest such an alternative.  *SIGH*  I
think this is gross negligence on someone's part, but it
is unfortunate that our customers will be the ones to
suffer for it.  I knew about the WF on NAD, but was told
that it enforced its own security, which it at least used
to because I frequently have gotten protection failures
trying to read source code I'm assembling (being in a
different GAN than most of NTD) when I forget to set RF.

I propose more investigation before any action, even
as gross as this appearently is, it can probably be 
left alone a couple more days.  I would normally
volunteer to help investigate, but this is a very bad
time.

Thanks

It sounds like you have done more investigation.  I did a tiny bit, too, and
I see (SOURCE)NAD with HF on 70.  Presumably that is the only way that
a customer can access the files in (SOURCE) since they are mostly ALL RD NO.
However, if NAD does not enforce security itself, this is still a problem
because we do not want customers to be able to read/write even the source
directory except to assemble (but not make listing of) the files therein.
Although this is a smaller box than (SYS)NAD with WF, it still needs to be
addressed one way or another.  -Bill

G'day!

I'm trying to investigate using the AUTOLOGOUT feature for
some of international customers.  Twice I have entered
SET AUTOLOGOUT, and waited 15 minutes for logoff.  At exactly
15 minutes, system 37 has crashed.

On the PDP-10, I am UPTHEGROVE, and there is an init file,
(UPTHEGROVE)INIT.SAI, which may, or may not, contribute.

My ONTYME is ISITPR.D/UPTHEGROVE.  I would like to know what you find out.  

I could sure use the autologout feature, especially if possible
to use at init time.

Best regards,  Dan

=======================================================================

	I tested on X95 and X930, it work correctly w/o crashing system.
Steve Atwell said, he tried on D37 and worked correctly also.  So there
might be something unique to network node he is originated and/or pass-
through nodes he is coming to D37.  I will follow up on this and find
out under what circumtances problem could be duplicated.

The immediate cause of the IME (Illegal Memory reference from Exec) was
due to the byte pointer at UPYUWM got changed from 001200,,374670 to
401202,,354670.  Bits 0 and 16 got set and bit 22 got cleared.  Several other
words in the vicinity of UPYUWM also got mangled - see below.

I think it was caused by the "SET AUTOLOGOUT" inactivity timer going off
while the user's context pages were swapped out.  This would not show up on 930
or 95 unless a bunch of memory hogs were logged in to force the idle job out.

any of the /B, /B-1, /B01, or /B04 monitors inDallas.  The only system that
had the patch was D55.  SYSTEM.SAV has been patched now.  /Joe

Subject: Re: SAXINY on system F74 
In-reply-to: your message of Mon, 3 Aug 87 22:09:51 PDT

SAXINY is new in /B10.  It means that COMMOD got an interrupt from the SA10
and the unit number stored in location 301 or 305 does not match the kontroller
data blocks.  For instance, if the disk channel interrupts with unit 277 (or
unit 0), COMMOD will check if it belongs to BPA (units 300-317) or BPB (units
320-337).  Since there is no Kontroller that claims that unit, COMMOD can't
do anything with the interrupt other than dismiss it.  Prior to /B10 there
was no indications when this occurred.  I added EVENT stopcode SAXINY so that
it would show up on the CTY.  My guess is that a disk caused a transfer-done
interrupt, but the 3672 reported a bogus unit.  COMMOD complains that it got
an interrupt from an unknown unit, then FILIO says THUNG because it missed
an interrupt it was expecting.  I will see if SAXINY can be modified to output
more info to catch the bad unit.  /Joe

Subject: Cause of SAXINY stopcodes. 

?INFO stopcode "SAXINY" at 02-Aug-1987 12:33:32   T4 = 400000,,421043
?INFO stopcode "SAXINY" at 02-Aug-1987 12:33:38   T4 = 400000,,421143

In the right half:
  400000 = Interrupt request from SA10
   20000 = SA10 channel 1 (disk) is enabled for interrupt
    1000 = The "GO" flag is set for SA10 channel 1 (disk)
     100 = Status available from channel 0 (tape)
      40 = Status available from channel 1 (disk)
       3 = SA10 is using PI channel 3

In the left half:
  400000 = Dummy bit set to indicate that one of bits 29-32 are set in RH
     000 = Octal unit device address (8 bits)

SAXINY means that one of the two disk controllers has told the SA10 to
interrupt the PDP-10, but the controller did not identify itself.  Controller
BPA (which is wired for 'C0' to 'CF') is supposed to report unit device
addresses in the range 300 to 317 and controller BPB (wired for 'D0' to 'DF')
is supposed to report unit device addresses in the range 320 to 337.  All the
SAXINY reports I have looked at show a unit device address of 000.  One of
the two controllers is returning bad status.

SAXINY occurs whenever the system gets an interrupt and cannot identify which
particular disk (or controller) was the cause of the interrupt.  THUNG occurs
when a disk transfer is started, but the "done" interrupt gets lost.  I would
expect each THUNG to be preceded by a SAXINY report.     /Joe

Please come skating tonight...Francie and I have been planning on meeting there tonight for two weeks, so I was planning on going, but I'd much prefer to have   you there instead. It would have nothing to do with rink politics...it would be
like having a date. And we need to have a date. We need it alot more than alot 
of other married couples, because we never got a chance before we were married.

Please say you'll go; I have to go out a do a few errands, but if you send me ma  
mail saying you'd like to go, I'll even bring you dinner (KFC, TOGO's, or what-
ever you want. I do think about you. I think about you all the time...even when
I start to feel that you prefer your terminals' company to mine (like, last nigh    night; that was why I couldn't getr to sleep.) It could even be therapeutic for
us; going back to the place where we first met. Please say you'll come. I do
love you. I do want to be with you. Stop worrying about the back yard, and
about the money, and about any other reasons not to go that you can come up with...we should go for us.

Hi! It's me...

I have a few quesitons for you:
1. Is it possible to print the following for my resume:
   o 12-pitch spacing
   o 10-pitch (pica) type
   o Courier or Academic Bookface typeface
I've been reading the resume book I got, and it recommends these, at the very begining. I need to know if I can get them from your computer/printer system.
Please respond asap, so I can get started with this. By the way, you left your
beeper again. ILYVMADYFI, /Waddle

P.S. - Also, when you get home will you show me how to break out part of an
existing file and make it a new file, with a new file name? My search.86 file
has gotten much too big, and I want to break out all of the 1987 info into a new file, called (are youready? This is really innovative) search.87. Thanks.

The 2020 with 3 RP06 disks is up an in the network as host 95.
SYSNO says X118 though, the real 95 (hardware CC) has an LP20 printer interface
on its UNIBUS but this system (118) does not.  That is the reason why hardware
DD cannot use 95's regular monitor.

Thanks - see you tomorrow 1:30 at my office.  Need directions?
You'll get to see the expression on Wayne's face when I show him
a two inch thick list of passwords I guessed last night.  (20,000)
He's never seen it before since I haven't run one since before he
took this job.  He doesn't know its coming so it will be a surprise.

I know where the building is..., as long as I keep the message with your
floor and cubicle number i shouldn't have too much trouble... although
I could use directions from the elevator on your floor, to your office.
I know what the layout of our floor in BLDG D looks like, so I presume the
standard elevator/facilities are similar.

I'd like to see the password list myself... you should have been able to
guess "MY" BUBBNET password.. it's an awkward (but correct) spelling of a
person's name... no spaces,numbers or special characters.

What is the top password?  "WELCOME"?

Have you put anything into your program to check for those people who
have taken things like "GO AWAY" or "ALICE" and changed them to "G0 AWAY"
and "AL1CE" or "A1ICE"  just to conform... still just as guessable if you
know the person/product/service only it conforms or is that c0nf0rms?

I know.... since my password is the name of a place (not in your dictionary)
that is mythical, with just such a misspelling to allow it to match the new
security spec of an imbedded non-alphabetic.

Subject: Meeting Info 

Please type (read) the file (CARL:930)SETOP.PRP prior to our meeting.  I
have updated the document to reflect the changes I've made to the design
(some of which are implemented in my test version).

Some questions I have -- open for discussion are:

1)  Who should be allowed to see what information in the oper database.
    At present, any manager may see any subordinate and any individual
    may see their own information.
    How do we allow anyone to grant license to someone NOT subordinate
    one or more levels below them? (If they cannot see them!)

2)  How do we want to make various users able to see and change everything?
    (I'm not asking for implementation details... I'm asking from a policy
     point of view... from a legality point of view [freedom of information
     and all that]).
    Obviously, WRS & CARL & a few others can change anything... but how do
    we want to officiate that capability...  especially in the case of a
    system disaster.

On a different topic... we should discuss any fallout from the NAD episode
of a week or two ago and how that changes would affect various support
and development groups.  (I haven't gotten back to Doug or Dennis on this).


...I'm fading... more questions, but I'm becomng incoherent... see you
both at 1:30pm at Bill's office.
